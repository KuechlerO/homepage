<h2>Who am I?</h2>
Hi, I'm Oliver (Kalule) K체chler :)

I was originally born in D체ren (NRW), Germany.
However, for my undergraduate studies I moved to the city Saarbr체cken in Saarland, which is at the borders to France and Luxembourg.
After my successful graduation with a Bachelor in Bioinformatics I decided to take a break from studies and do instead a voluntary social year with the humanitarian organization <a href="https://adra.org/" target="_blank">ADRA</a> in Uganda.
Enriched by countless inspiring encounters and unique experiences which pushed me strongly forward in my personal development, I chose to continue with my Bioinformatics studies in Berlin at Freie Universit채t Berlin.
And here I am today: Closely to the end of my studies of my Master in Bioinformatics.

<h4>In my freetime you will find me:</h4>

      <li>Doing some sports like jogging, tennis and volleyball</li>
      <li>Having joint breakfast or dinner meetings with my housemates in the student-dorm</li>
			<li>Practising my french skills</li>
