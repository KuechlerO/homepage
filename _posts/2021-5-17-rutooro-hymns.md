During my year abroad in Uganda, I traveled a lot and met many different communities.
One of the peculiarities of Uganda is that although the official languages are Swahili and English, tribal and area-dependent languages such as Luganda, Runyankole, or Rutooro are often spoken in an Ugandan's daily live.

I spent the last two months of my volunteer service in the southwest of Uganda
<a href="https://olisabenteuerinuganda.wordpress.com/2019/06/18/yamba-olubuto-lwo/" target="_blank">(see this blog entry)</a>
in an area where Rutooro was primarily spoken. In this area, I was able to meet many interesting and inspiring individuals and build important friendships.
Sabitii David, one of my local co-workers and friends, eventually animated me to develop a smartphone app for church songs translated into the local Rutooro language.
With this app, people with smartphones have the ability to join in worship in churches quickly and inexpensively, even without a songbook.

And that's how the app "SDA - RutooroHymns" was finally developed.
Currently the app has been installed over <b><i>1000 times</i></b> (May, 2021).
