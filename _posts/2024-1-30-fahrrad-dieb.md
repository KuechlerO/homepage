Something that I never thought would happen to me, happened to me: My bike was stolen.
Well ok, I'm living in Berlin and I know that bike theft is a common thing here. 
But my bike was super-old (I already bought it used on a flee market) and I had it for over 3 years 
without any problems...
But then, one day, it was gone.
But let's start from the beginning:

<h3>The shocking moment</h3>
I was on my way home from work.
So I arrived at S-Bahnhof Nikolassee and wanted to take my bike from the bike stand in front of the station building.
**But it was gone.**
I couldn't believe it.
Especially because I had just colored the bike frame with a bright yellow and red colors a few weeks ago and even put 
some new tires on it.
I was so angry and sad at the same time.
The following days I was looking for my bike everywhere, but my hopes were pretty low.
But then...

<h3>The lucky catch</h3>
Friday evening, three days after the incident, I forced myself to take a last look online to see if I 
could find my bike.
My hope was that the thief would try to sell it on eBay or something like that.
And yes indeed, I was lucky.
On eBay `Kleinanzeigen` (now renamed into `kleinanzeigen.de`) I found my bike.
I couldn't believe it.
Instantely I wrote the seller a message and asked him if I could come by and take a look at the bike.
However, the thief kept me waiting.
Then, Saturday morning a message came in.
"Yes, the bicycle is still available. When would you like to come by?"

<h3>What now? - The plan</h3>
I was so excited.
This was my chance to get my bike back.
But how exactly?
Should I just confront the thief?
Should I take my bicycle back by force?
Should I take friends with me?

But responsible as I am, I decided to call the police. 
Yes, **the police**.
And they agreed to help me.
Morever, they told me that I should not go to the meeting point alone.
Instead they would send a whole undercover team to come along with me to catch the thief.
And that's how it happened.


<h3>The police and me</h3>
It was just like in the movies:  
I was standing at the meeting point, prepared to meet the thief and to get my bike back.
Yet, I was not alone.
Eight undercover agents were there for my support.
Some of them were hiding behind a corner, while others were watching the scene from a distance (sitting in a caf√© on the other street side, no joke!).
Then, the thief came with my bike, I was pretending to be interested in buying it.
At some point I wanted to know from the "seller" some details about the bike when suddenly the undercover agents came out of their hiding places and swarmed the thief.

**"Keine Bewegung! Polizei Berlin!"**

He was caught, pushed to the ground, handcuffed and taken away.
I was astonished.
I had not anticipated that the police would act so quickly and decisively.
But I was happy: I got my bike back.

<h3>I'm a celebrity</h3>
Apparently, the story was so exciting that the BILD newspaper wrote an article about it.
I was interviewed by a journalist and a photographer took some pictures of me and my bike.
My article even ended up being displayed in the print version of the newspaper.
But most excitingly I ended up in the "Berliner Fenster" (the displays all over the U-Bahn wagons in Berlin).
